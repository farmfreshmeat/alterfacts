## Day 2 - January 21, 2017

> "Had a great meeting at CIA Headquarters yesterday, packed house, paid great respect to Wall, long standing ovations, amazing people. WIN " - Donald J. Trump via [twitter](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/823146987117772800)

> "But, we had a massive field of people . You saw that. Packed. I get up this morning. I turn on one of the networks and they show an empty field. I say: “Wait a minute. I made a speech . I looked out. The field was…. It looked like a million, a million and a half people."
> "We had 250,000 people literally around, you know, the little bowl that we constructed. That was 250,000 people. The rest of the 20 block area all the way back to the Washington Monument was packed. So we caught them. And we caught them in a beauty. And I think they’re going to pay a big price."

## Day 3 - January 22, 2017

### ALTERNATE FACTS ARE BORN

> "You're saying it's a falsehood. And they're giving -- Sean Spicer, our press secretary -- gave alternative facts" - Kellyanne Conway, ["Meet The Press"](http://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/video/conway-press-secretary-gave-alternative-facts-860142147643)

## Day 5 - January 24, 2017

> “I think there have been studies, there was one that came out of Pew in 2008 that showed 14 percent of people who have voted were not citizens. There are other studies that were presented to him.”

#### the truth

> "We found millions of out of date registration records due to people moving or dying, but found no evidence that voter fraud resulted." - David Becker, Executive Director, The Center for Election Innovation & Research via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/beckerdavidj/status/803301967875321857?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

## Day 6 - January 25, 2017

### Voter Fraud

>"I will be asking for a major investigation into VOTER FRAUD, including those registered to vote in two states, those who are illegal and.." -- Donald Trump via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/824227824903090176)

#### the truth

Being registered in two states is not voter fraud. It is extremely common, because when people move, there is no automatic mechanism to un-register them from their prior place of registration. Voter rolls are purged periodically, but no evidence exists of any widespread double-voting because of duplicate registrations.

"Why voters are removed from the rolls explained" - via [NPR](http://www.npr.org/2016/04/20/474990269/why-voters-are-removed-from-the-rolls-explained)

> But if the voter doesn't show up for two federal elections in a row, his name can legitimately be removed 
> from the rolls. A name can also be removed if election officials verify that the individual has died, moved
> to another jurisdiction or is not allowed to vote for some other reason.

#### steve bannon is registered in two places, and one of them may be illegal

"[Trump's senior advisor] Steve Bannon is registered to vote in two states" - via [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/25/steve-bannon-voter-registration-trump-election-voter-fraud)

"Donald Trump adviser Stephen Bannon is registered to vote in two states – which US President wrongly calls voter fraud" -- via [The Independent](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/donald-trump-steve-bannon-white-house-chief-strategy-adviser-registered-vote-two-states-voter-fraud-a7546146.html)

> Stephen Bannon registered to vote in New York prior to the election, but he still is registered to vote in
> Florida. He cast only one ballot in New York. 
 
> Florida state records show that Mr Bannon is registered at the home of a former Breitbart colleague, Andy 
> Badolato. It remains unclear whether Mr Bannon actually lived at the property – a requirement of Florida 
> registration rules – at the time of his registration. 

### Dow Jones hits 20,000

> "The Trump Effect" - Kellyanne Conway vis [Twitter](https://twitter.com/KellyannePolls/status/824269356582453250)

... retweeting 

> "President #Trump's early policy follow through propels Dow to 20K #Dow20K #WallStreet  http://fxn.ws/2j4HNnu" - Fox Business via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/FoxBusiness/status/824263996631027713)

This isn't really a big lie, but certainly unprovable, and correlation does not imply causation. Nor do short term dow jones fluctuations mean much of anything. Suggest we revisit this in a year or two.

For reference, when Obama took office on January 20, 2009, the Dow closed at 7,949.09. On January 20, 2017, it closed at 19,827.25.
