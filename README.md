> "But, we had a massive field of people . You saw that. Packed. I get up this morning. I turn on one of the networks and they show an empty field. I say: “Wait a minute. I made a speech . I looked out. The field was…. It looked like a million, a million and a half people."
> "We had 250,000 people literally around, you know, the little bowl that we constructed. That was 250,000 people. The rest of the 20 block area all the way back to the Washington Monument was packed. So we caught them. And we caught them in a beauty. And I think they’re going to pay a big price."
